      <h1 class="fw-bold">About the Project</h1>
      <p class="text-muted">
        <strong>Visit Me</strong> is more than a travel app — it's a platform designed to bridge curiosity with discovery.
        The idea began as part of my final project for the Full-Stack Web Development diploma at Code Institute,
        and evolved into a passion-driven solution to help people explore both famous destinations and hidden corners of the world.
      </p>
      <p class="text-muted">
        We’re building a travel space where users can not only find beautiful countries, cities, and landmarks, but soon,
        contribute their own discoveries through the upcoming <strong>Hidden Gems</strong> section. Whether it’s a quiet spot in a park,
        a tucked-away cafe, or a breathtaking view off the beaten path — Visit Me will become a community where these
        gems can be shared, rated, and remembered.

  <!-- Developer Bio -->
  <div class="mb-5">
    <h2 class="fw-bold">About the Developer</h2>
    <p class="text-muted">
      I'm <strong>Omer Ahmed</strong>, a full-stack web developer based in Austria with a deep appreciation for design, storytelling,
      and meaningful user experience. Before entering web development, I spent time learning and experimenting with digital design, content creation,
      and community-building platforms. This background shaped how I approach building tools that don’t just function — they connect.
    </p>
    <p class="text-muted">
      Throughout my journey at Code Institute, I embraced Django as my primary backend framework, combining it with PostgreSQL, Bootstrap, and JavaScript
      to create a responsive, scalable, and interactive product. Every piece of the app — from rating systems to wishlists — was handcrafted to reflect real-world usability.
    </p>
    <p class="text-muted">
      I believe technology should empower people to connect more deeply with the world around them. That’s what I hope Visit Me will do.
    </p>

  <!-- Mission / Future Vision -->
  <div class="mb-5">
    <h2 class="fw-bold">Where It’s Going</h2>
    <p class="text-muted">
      The first phase of Visit Me focuses on curated listings. The next phase will empower users to shape the platform — through uploading their own hidden places,
      reviewing, commenting, and building a shared travel culture built on local love and global curiosity.
    </p>
    <p class="text-muted">
      My goal is to eventually evolve Visit Me into a mobile-first app with real-time contributions, user profiles, and map-based discovery —
      a go-to community for curious explorers everywhere.
    </p>

  <!-- Thanks -->
  <div class="mb-5">
    <h2 class="fw-bold">A Note of Thanks</h2>
    <p class="text-muted">
      I’m incredibly thankful for the learning experience provided by <strong>Code Institute</strong>, and especially to
      <strong>Mr. Spencer Barriball</strong>, whose insightful mentorship, kind feedback, and dedication helped guide this project from concept to reality.
      Also, thanks to every peer and instructor who shared knowledge along the way — I wouldn't be here without that community.
